# SalesTaxes
My personal solution of SalesTaxes Problem : https://github.com/luigiberrettini/sales-taxes-kata#readme
I wrote it in Java using JDK15 in april 2021.

CONFIGURATION FILES
The application needs two files:
* Categories.txt that contains a list of "product"-"product's category" like "chocolate bar-food"
* TaxedProduct.txt taht contains the list of "category"/"boolean that means if the category is taxed or not" like "food/False"
  
Application's input required:
* (1)Shopping Basket file's path.
* (2)Categories file's path.
* (3)Taxes file's path.
* (4)Receipt file's path. [optional]

Run without arguments for help.
